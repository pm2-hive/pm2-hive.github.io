## PM2 Process Management Quick Start

PM2 is a daemon process manager that will help you manage and keep your application online. Getting started with PM2 is straightforward, it is offered as a simple and intuitive CLI, installable via NPM.

### Installation

The latest PM2 version is installable with NPM or Yarn:

```bash
$ npm install pm2@latest -g
# or
$ yarn global add pm2
```

To install Node.js and NPM you can use [NVM](https://yoember.com/nodejs/the-best-way-to-install-node-js/)

### Start an app

The simplest way to start, daemonize and monitor your application is by using this command line:

```bash
$ pm2 start app.js
```

Or start any other application easily:

```bash
$ pm2 start bashscript.sh
$ pm2 start python-app.py --watch
$ pm2 start binary-file -- --port 1520
```

Some options you can pass to the CLI:

```bash
# Specify an app name
--name <app_name>

# Watch and Restart app when files change
--watch

# Set memory threshold for app reload
--max-memory-restart <200MB>

# Specify log file
--log <log_path>

# Pass extra arguments to the script
-- arg1 arg2 arg3

# Delay between automatic restarts
--restart-delay <delay in ms>

# Prefix logs with time
--time

# Do not auto restart app
--no-autorestart

# Specify cron for forced restart
--cron <cron_pattern>

# Attach to application log
--no-daemon
```

As you can see many options are available to manage your application with PM2. You will discover them depending on your use case.

## Managing processes

Managing application state is simple here are the commands:

```bash
$ pm2 restart app_name
$ pm2 reload app_name
$ pm2 stop app_name
$ pm2 delete app_name
```

Instead of `app_name` you can pass:
- `all` to act on all processes
- `id` to act on a specific process id

## Check status, logs, metrics

Now that you have started this application, you can check its status, logs, metrics and even get the online dashboard with <a href="https://pm2.io" target="_blank">pm2.io</a>.

### List managed applications

List the status of all application managed by PM2:

```bash
$ pm2 [list|ls|status]
```

### Display logs

To display logs in realtime:

```bash
$ pm2 logs
```

To dig in older logs:

```bash
$ pm2 logs --lines 200
```

### Terminal Based Dashboard

Here is a realtime dashboard that fits directly into your terminal:

```bash
$ pm2 monit
```

### pm2.io: Monitoring & Diagnostic Web Interface

Web based dashboard, cross servers with diagnostic system:

```bash
$ pm2 plus
```

## Cluster mode

For Node.js applications, PM2 includes an automatic load balancer that will share all HTTP[s]/Websocket/TCP/UDP connections between each spawned processes.

To start an application in Cluster mode:

```
$ pm2 start app.js -i max
```

Read more about cluster mode [here](/docs/usage/cluster-mode/).

## Ecosystem File

You can also create a configuration file, called Ecosystem File, to manage multiple applications.
To generate an Ecosystem file:

```bash
$ pm2 ecosystem
```

This will generate an ecosystem.config.js file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps : [{
    name: "app",
    script: "./app.js",
    env: {
      NODE_ENV: "development",
    },
    env_production: {
      NODE_ENV: "production",
    }
  }, {
     name: 'worker',
     script: 'worker.js'
  }]
}
```

And start it easily:

```bash
$ pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

Read more about application declaration [here](/docs/usage/application-declaration/).

## Setup startup script

Restarting PM2 with the processes you manage on server boot/reboot is critical. To solve this, just run this command to generate an active startup script:

```bash
$ pm2 startup
```

And to freeze a process list for automatic respawn:

```bash
$ pm2 save
```
Read more about startup script generator [here](/docs/usage/startup/).

## Restart application on changes

It's pretty easy with the `--watch` option:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/my/app
$ pm2 start env.js --watch --ignore-watch="node_modules"
```

This will watch & restart the app on any file change from the current directory + all subfolders and it will ignore any changes in the node_modules folder `--ignore-watch="node_modules"`.

You can then use `pm2 logs` to check for restarted app logs.

## Updating PM2

We made it simple, there is no breaking change between releases and the procedure is straightforward:

```bash
npm install pm2@latest -g
```

Then update the in-memory PM2 :

```bash
pm2 update
```

## CheatSheet

Here are some commands that are worth knowing. Just try them with a sample application or with your current web application on your development machine:

```bash
# Fork mode
pm2 start app.js --name my-api # Name process

# Cluster mode
pm2 start app.js -i 0        # Will start maximum processes with LB depending on available CPUs
pm2 start app.js -i max      # Same as above, but deprecated.
pm2 scale app +3             # Scales `app` up by 3 workers
pm2 scale app 2              # Scales `app` up or down to 2 workers total

# Listing

pm2 list               # Display all processes status
pm2 jlist              # Print process list in raw JSON
pm2 prettylist         # Print process list in beautified JSON

pm2 describe 0         # Display all information about a specific process

pm2 monit              # Monitor all processes

# Logs

pm2 logs [--raw]       # Display all processes logs in streaming
pm2 flush              # Empty all log files
pm2 reloadLogs         # Reload all logs

# Actions

pm2 stop all           # Stop all processes
pm2 restart all        # Restart all processes

pm2 reload all         # Will 0s downtime reload (for NETWORKED apps)

pm2 stop 0             # Stop specific process id
pm2 restart 0          # Restart specific process id

pm2 delete 0           # Will remove process from pm2 list
pm2 delete all         # Will remove all processes from pm2 list

# Misc

pm2 reset <process>    # Reset meta data (restarted time...)
pm2 updatePM2          # Update in memory pm2
pm2 ping               # Ensure pm2 daemon has been launched
pm2 sendSignal SIGUSR2 my-app # Send system signal to script
pm2 start app.js --no-daemon

## How to update PM2

Install the latest pm2 version:

```bash
npm install pm2@latest -g
```

Then update the in-memory PM2 :

```bash
pm2 update
```


## Configuration File

When managing multiple applications with PM2, use a JS configuration file to organize them.

### Generate configuration

To generate a sample configuration file you can type this command:

```bash
$ pm2 init simple
```

This will generate a sample `ecosystem.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps : [{
    name   : "app1",
    script : "./app.js"
  }]
}
```

If you are creating your own configuration file, make sure it ends with `.config.js` so PM2 is able to recognize it as a configuration file.

### Acting on Configuration File

Seamlessly than acting on an app you can start/stop/restart/delete all apps contained in a configuration file:

```bash
# Start all applications
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js

# Stop all
pm2 stop ecosystem.config.js

# Restart all
pm2 restart ecosystem.config.js

# Reload all
pm2 reload ecosystem.config.js

# Delete all
pm2 delete ecosystem.config.js
```

#### Act on a specific process

You can also act on a particular application by using its name and the option `--only <app_name>`:

```bash
pm2 start   ecosystem.config.js --only api-app
```

*Note*: the `--only` option works for start/restart/stop/delete as well

You can even specify multiple apps to be acted on by specifying each app name separated by a comma:

```bash
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --only "api-app,worker-app"
```

### Switching environments

You can specify different environment variable set via the `env_*` option.

Example:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps : [{
    name   : "app1",
    script : "./app.js",
    env_production: {
       NODE_ENV: "production"
    },
    env_development: {
       NODE_ENV: "development"
    }
  }]
}
```

Now to switch between variables in different environment, specify the `--env [env name]` option:

```bash
pm2 start process.json --env production
pm2 restart process.json --env development
```

post-deploy|post-deploy action|String|

### Considerations

All command line options passed when using the JSON app declaration will be dropped i.e.

#### CWD

**cwd:** your JSON declaration does not need to reside with your script.  If you wish to maintain the JSON(s) in a location other than your script (say, `/etc/pm2/conf.d/node-app.json`) you will need to use the `cwd` feature (Note, this can be really helpful for capistrano style directory structures that uses symlinks). Files can be either relative to the `cwd` directory, or absolute (see example below).

### CLI/JSON options

All the keys can be used in a JSON configured file, but will remain almost the same on the command line e.g.:

```
exec_mode         -> --execute-command
max_restarts      -> --max-restarts
force             -> --force
```

Using quotes to make an ESC, e.g.:

```bash
$pm2 start test.js --node-args "port=3001 sitename='first pm2 app'"
```

The `nodeArgs` argument will be parsed as

```JSON
[
  "port=3001",
  "sitename=first pm2 app"
]
```

but not

```JSON
[
  "port=3001",
  "sitename='first",
  "pm2",
  "app'"
]
```

### Disabling logs

You can pass `/dev/null` to error_file or out_file to disable logs saving.
Note: starting PM2 `2.4.0`, `/dev/null` or `NULL` disable logs independently of the platform.

### Logs suffix

You can disable automatic ID suffixes on logs (e.g. `app-name-ID.log`) by passing enabling the option `merge_logs: true`

### Environment definition

You'll need to use `--env <envname>` to tell pm2 to use specific environment defined inside a process file :

```json
{
  "apps" : [{
    "name"        : "worker",
    "script"      : "./worker.js",
    "watch"       : true,
    "env": {
      "NODE_ENV": "development"
    },
    "env_production" : {
       "NODE_ENV": "production"
    }
  },{
    "name"       : "api-app",
    "script"     : "./api.js",
    "instances"  : 4,
    "exec_mode"  : "cluster"
  }]
}
```

In this example, you will run `pm2 start ecosystem.json` and it will start your application with the default environment (in development so).
Then you use `pm2 start ecosystem.json --env production` and it will use the attribute `env_<name>` where name is `production` here, so it will start your app with `NODE_ENV=production`.

### Special `ext_type`

- min_uptime
  Value of `min_uptime` can be:
    - **Number**
      e.g. `"min_uptime": 3000` means 3000 milliseconds.
    - **String**
      Therefore, we are making it short and easy to configure: `h`, `m` and `s`, e.g.: `"min_uptime": "1h"` means one hour, `"min_uptime": "5m"` means five minutes and `"min_uptime": "10s"` means ten seconds (those will be transformed into milliseconds).

- max_memory_restart
  Value of `max_memory_restart` can be:
    - **Number**
        e.g. `"max_memory_restart": 1024` means 1024 bytes (**NOT BITS**).
    - **String**
        Therefore, we are making it short and easy to configure: `G`, `M` and `K`, e.g.: `"max_memory_restart": "1G"` means one gigabyte, `"max_memory_restart": "5M"` means five megabytes and `"max_memory_restart": "10K"` means ten kilobytes (those will be transformed into byte(s)).

- Optional values
  For example `exec_mode` can take `cluster` (`cluster_mode`) or `fork` (`fork_mode`) as possible values.

- Things to know
  - `"instances": 0` means that PM2 will launch the maximum processes possible according to the numbers of CPUs (cluster mode)
  - array
  `args`, `node_args` and `ignore_watch` could be type of `Array` (e.g.: `"args": ["--toto=heya coco", "-d", "1"]`) or `string` (e.g.: `"args": "--to='heya coco' -d 1"`)


## Cluster Mode

The **cluster mode** allows networked Node.js applications (http(s)/tcp/udp server) to be scaled across all CPUs available, without any code modifications. This greatly increases the performance and reliability of your applications, depending on the number of CPUs available.  Under the hood, this uses the Node.js [cluster module](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html) such that the scaled application's child processes can automatically share server ports. To learn more, see [How It Works](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html#cluster_how_it_works) in the official Node.js documentation on the cluster module.

![http://i.imgur.com/kTAowsL.png](http://i.imgur.com/kTAowsL.png)

## Usage

To enable the **cluster mode**, just pass the -i <instances> option:

```bash
pm2 start app.js -i max
```

`max` means that PM2 will auto detect the number of available CPUs and run as many processes as possible

Or via a [js/yaml/json file](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/application-declaration/):

```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps : [{
    script    : "api.js",
    instances : "max",
    exec_mode : "cluster"
  }]
}
```

**NOTE**: you need to set the exec_mode to `cluster` so PM2 know you want to load balance between each instances, by default it will not

Then to start the Process File:

```bash
pm2 start processes.json
```

The *-i* or *instances* option can be:
- **0/max** to spread the app across all CPUs
- **-1** to spread the app across all CPUs - 1
- **number** to spread the app across **number** CPUs

## Reload

As opposed to `restart`, which kills and restarts the process, `reload` achieves a **0-second-downtime** reload.

To reload an app:

```bash
pm2 reload <app_name>
```

Or:

```bash
pm2 reload process.json
pm2 reload process.json --only api
```

If the reload system hasn't managed to reload your application, a timeout will fallback to a classic restart.

## Graceful Shutdown

In production environment, you may need to wait for remaining queries to be processed or close all connections before exiting the application. On the *PM2 reload context* it can be translated into a very long reload or a reload that doesn't work (fallback to restart) meaning that your application still has open connections on exit. You may alternatively need to close all databases connections, clear data queues or whatever.

To Gracefully Shutdown an application you can catch the **SIGINT** signal (the first signal sent on exit by PM2) and execute actions to wait/clear all these states:

```javascript
process.on('SIGINT', function() {
   db.stop(function(err) {
     process.exit(err ? 1 : 0);
   });
});
```

[Read more about Graceful Shutdown](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/signals-clean-restart/) feature.

## Statelessify your application

Be sure your [**application is stateless**](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/specifics/#stateless-apps) meaning that no local data is stored in the process, for example sessions/websocket connections, session-memory and related. Use Redis, Mongo or other databases to share states between processes.

Another resource on how to write efficient, production ready stateless application is [The Twelve Factor Application manifesto](https://12factor.net/).


## Contributing/Development mode

It's very simple to play with PM2:

```bash
pm2 kill   # kill the current pm2
git clone my_pm2_fork.git
cd pm2/
DEBUG=* ./bin/pm2 --no-daemon
```

Each time you edit the code, be sure to kill and restart PM2 to make changes taking effect.


**DEBUG="*"** Allows to display all possible debug logs in ~/.pm2/pm2.log

## Install PM2 development

```bash
npm install https://github.com/Unitech/pm2#development -g
```

## Launch the tests

Master: [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/Unitech/pm2/master.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/Unitech/pm2)

Dev   : [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/Unitech/pm2/development.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/Unitech/pm2)

Just try the tests before using PM2 on your production server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Unitech/pm2.git
cd pm2
npm install  # Or do NODE_ENV=development npm install if some packages are missing
npm test
```

If a test is not correctly working, please report issues [here](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/issues?state=open).
You should also make sure that you have all dependencies needed. 
For Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential
# nvm is a Node.js version manager - https://github.com/creationix/nvm
wget -qO- https://raw.github.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | sh
nvm install 4
nvm use 4
```


## Deployment System

PM2 features a simple but powerful deployment system that allows to provision and update applications in production environment. This is great when you want to deploy applications on a baremetal server in one or many servers at once. 

```bash
> pm2 deploy <configuration_file> <environment> <command>

  Commands:
    setup                run remote setup commands
    update               update deploy to the latest release
    revert [n]           revert to [n]th last deployment or 1
    curr[ent]            output current release commit
    prev[ious]           output previous release commit
    exec|run <cmd>       execute the given <cmd>
    list                 list previous deploy commits
    [ref]                deploy to [ref], the "ref" setting, or latest tag
```

Basically you only need to add a "deploy" attribute to the ecosystem.json. Here is a bare minimum to deploy an application:

To configure the deployment system, add a `deploy` attribute to the Application Configuration File:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps : [{
    script: 'api.js',
  }, {
    script: 'worker.js'
  }],
   
  // Deployment Configuration
  deploy : {
    production : {
       "user" : "ubuntu",
       "host" : ["192.168.0.13", "192.168.0.14", "192.168.0.15"],
       "ref"  : "origin/master",
       "repo" : "git@github.com:Username/repository.git",
       "path" : "/var/www/my-repository",
       "post-deploy" : "npm install"
    }
  }
};
```

**Note**: make sure the application configuration file in the local folder is named either ecosystem.config.js or pm2.config.js, so you don't need to type the configuration filename for each command.

### Provision remote server

Before provisioning remote server verify that:

- Remote servers have PM2 installed
- Remote servers have granted permissions to GIT clone the target repository

Once remote servers have been configured you can start provisioning them:

```bash
$ pm2 deploy production setup
```

**Note**: as the app configuration file is named ecosystem.config.js or pm2.config.js in the local folder, you do not need to specify the filename each time

### Deploy application

Once the remote server have been provisioned you can now deploy the application:

```bash
$ pm2 deploy production
```

**Note**: if git report an error that there are local changes but still want to push what is on the remote GIT, you can use the `--force` option to force deployment. 

### Rollback to previous deployment

If you need to rollback to previous deployment you can use the `revert` option:

```bash
# Revert to -1 deployment
$ pm2 deploy production revert 1
```

### Execute a command on each server

To execute a one-time running command you can use the `exec` option:

```bash
$ pm2 deploy production exec "pm2 reload all"
```

### Specifics

#### Deployment Lifecycle

When deploying with PM2, you can specify what do before/after setup and before/after update:

```
"pre-setup" : "echo 'commands or local script path to be run on the host before the setup process starts'",
"post-setup": "echo 'commands or a script path to be run on the host after cloning the repo'",
"pre-deploy" : "pm2 startOrRestart ecosystem.json --env production",
"post-deploy" : "pm2 startOrRestart ecosystem.json --env production",
"pre-deploy-local" : "echo 'This is a local executed command'"
```

#### Multi host deployment

To deploy to multiple hosts in the same time, you just have to declare each host in an array under the attribute `host`.

```
"host" : ["212.83.163.1", "212.83.163.2", "212.83.163.3"],
```

#### Specifying SSH keys

You just have to add the "key" attribute with path to the public key, see below example :

```javascript
    "production" : {
      "key"  : "/path/to/some.pem", // path to the public key to authenticate
      "user" : "node",              // user used to authenticate
      "host" : "212.83.163.1",      // where to connect
      "ref"  : "origin/master",
      "repo" : "git@github.com:repo.git",
      "path" : "/var/www/production",
      "post-deploy" : "pm2 startOrRestart ecosystem.json --env production"
    },
```

### Troubleshooting

#### SSH clone errors

In most cases, these errors will be caused by `pm2` not having the correct keys to clone your repository. You need to verify at every step that the keys are available.

__Step 1__
If you are certain your keys are correctly working, first try running `git clone your_repo.git` on the target server. If it succeeds, move onto the next steps. If it failed, make sure your keys are stored both on the server and on your git account.

__Step 2__
By default `ssh-copy-id` copies the default identity, usually named `id_rsa`. If that is not the appropriate key:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i path/to/my/key your_username@server.com
```
This adds your public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

__Step 3__
If you get the following error:
```
--> Deploying to production environment
--> on host mysite.com
  ○ hook pre-setup
  ○ running setup
  ○ cloning git@github.com:user/repo.git
Cloning into '/var/www/app/source'...
Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights and that the repository exists.

**Failed to clone**

Deploy failed
```
...you may want to create a ssh config file. This is a sure way to ensure that the correct ssh keys are used for any given repository you're trying to clone. See [this example](https://gist.github.com/Protosac/c3fb459b1a942f161f23556f61a67d66):

```
# ~/.ssh/config
Host alias
    HostName myserver.com
    User username
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/mykey
# Usage: `ssh alias`
# Alternative: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/mykey username@myserver.com`

Host deployment
    HostName github.com
    User username
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github_rsa
# Usage:
# git@deployment:username/anyrepo.git
# This is for cloning any repo that uses that IdentityFile. This is a good way to make sure that your remote cloning commands use the appropriate key
```

## Docker Integration

Using Containers? We got your back. Start today using **pm2-runtime**, a perfect companion to get the most out of Node.js in production environment.

The goal of pm2-runtime is to wrap your applications into a proper Node.js production environment. It solves major issues when running Node.js applications inside a container like:

- Second Process Fallback for High Application Reliability
- Process Flow Control
- Automatic Application Monitoring to keep it always sane and high performing
- Automatic Source Map Discovery and Resolving Support 

Further than that, using PM2 as a layer between the container and the application brings PM2 powerful features like [application declaration file](/docs/usage/application-declaration/), [customizable log system](/docs/usage/log-management/) and other great features to manage your Node.js application in production environment.

## Use PM2 inside Containers

In your Dockerfile add this line to install PM2:

```
RUN npm install pm2 -g
```

Then replace the `node` binary with `pm2-runtime` 

```
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

to:

```
CMD ["pm2-runtime", "app.js"]
```

**You are now all set!** Your Node.js application is now wrapped into a proper Node.js production environment.

### Starting a configuration file

Instead of running your raw Node.js application with PM2, you can declare it into a configuration file (or process file) and set some configuration variables, like enabling the cluster mode.

Let's create a ecosystem.config.js file with this content:

```javascript
module.exports = [{
  script: 'app.js',
  name: 'app',
  exec_mode: 'cluster',
  instances: 2
}, {
  script: 'worker.js',
  name: 'worker'
}]
```

All options available are [listed here](/docs/usage/application-declaration/#attributes-available).

You can then replace the **CMD** directive by this:

```
CMD ["pm2-runtime", "process.yml"]
```

To split each processes in its own Docker, you can use the --only [app-name] option:

```
CMD ["pm2-runtime", "process.yml", "--only", "APP"]
```

### Using exec_mode cluster together with nuxtjs

When running pm2 in cluster mode, `ecosystem.config.js` will be appended to your cwd path due to how nuxtjs parses its rootDir, to fix that you have to specify the config path in your args section:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps: [
    {
      name: 'my-nuxtjs-app',
      exec_mode: 'cluster',
      instances: 2,
      cwd: '/var/www',
      script: './node_modules/nuxt-start/bin/nuxt-start.js',
      args: '-c /var/www/nuxt.config.js'
    }
  ]
}
```

### Logging Format option

If you want to change the log output format you can select one of this options:

- **--json**: will output logs in JSON format (logstash)
- **--format**: will output logs in = style format
- **--raw**: will output logs as is

To use one of this flag, you just need to pass them to pm2-runtime:

```
CMD ["pm2-runtime", "--json", "process.yml"]
```

### Enabling Graceful Shutdown

When the Container receives a shutdown signal, PM2 forwards this signal to your application allowing to close all the database connections, wait that all queries have been processed or that any other final processing has been completed before a successful graceful shutdown.

Catching a shutdown signal is straightforward. You need to add a listener in your Node.js applications and execute anything needed before stopping the app:

```javascript
process.on('SIGINT', function() {
   db.stop(function(err) {
     process.exit(err ? 1 : 0);
   });
});
```

By default PM2 will wait 1600ms before sending a final SIGKILL signal. You can modify this delay by setting the `kill_timeout` option inside your application configuration file.

Read more about application state management [here](/docs/usage/signals-clean-restart/)

### Development environment

You may want to tell Developers to program inside a container to keep a consistent environment between development, test and production.

Replacing **pm2-runtime** with **pm2-dev** will enable the watch and restart features. This is quite interesting in a development container when the host files are exposed to the container as a VOLUME.

### Using PM2.io

[Keymetrics.io](https://keymetrics.io/) is a monitoring service built on top of PM2 that allows to monitor and manage applications easily (logs, restart, exceptions monitoring...). Once you created a Bucket on Keymetrics you will get a public and a secret key.

To enable Keymetrics monitoring with **pm2-runtime**, you can either use the CLI option **--public XXX** and **--secret YYY** or pass the environment variables **KEYMETRICS_PUBLIC** and **KEYMETRICS_SECRET**.

Example with the CLI options via a Dockerfile:

```
CMD ["pm2-runtime", "--public", "XXX", "--secret", "YYY", "process.yml"]
```

Or via environment variables:

```
ENV PM2_PUBLIC_KEY=XXX
ENV PM2_SECRET_KEY=YYY
```

Or via the Docker run command:

```
docker run --net host -e "PM2_PUBLIC_KEY=XXX" -e "PM2_SECRET_KEY=XXX" <...>
```

## pm2-runtime Helper

Here is the pm2-runtime helper:

```
>>> pm2-runtime -h

  Usage: pm2-runtime app.js

  pm2-runtime is a drop-in replacement node.js binary with some interesting production features

  Options:

    -V, --version              output the version number
    -i --instances <number>    launch [number] of processes automatically load-balanced. Increase overall performances and performance stability.
    --secret [key]             [MONITORING] keymetrics secret key
    --public [key]             [MONITORING] keymetrics public key
    --machine-name [name]      [MONITORING] keymetrics machine name
    --raw                      raw log output
    --json                     output logs in json format
    --format                   output logs formatted like key=val
    --delay <seconds>          delay start of configuration file by <seconds>
    --web [port]               launch process web api on [port] (default to 9615)
    --only <application-name>  only act on one application of configuration
    --no-auto-exit             do not exit if all processes are errored/stopped or 0 apps launched
    --env [name]               inject env_[name] env variables in process config file
    --watch                    watch and restart application on file change
    --error <path>             error log file destination (default disabled)
    --output <path>            output log file destination (default disabled)
    -h, --help                 output usage information


  Commands:

    *
    start <app.js|json_file>  start an application or json ecosystem file
```


## When starting a new process

PM2 will inject environment in this order when **starting** a new process :

- First the PM2 CLI will use its environment so the current environment of your shell will be injected.
- PM2 will then inject the environment that you can configure with the ecosystem file :

```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps : [
      {
        name: "myapp",
        script: "./app.js",
        watch: true,
        env: {
          "NODE_ENV": "development",
        }
      }
  ]
}
```

Here you can see that PM2 will override the current environment to add `NODE_ENV=development`. But you can also define different environments like this :

```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps : [
      {
        name: "myapp",
        script: "./app.js",
        watch: true,
        env: {
            "PORT": 3000,
            "NODE_ENV": "development"
        },
        env_production: {
            "PORT": 80,
            "NODE_ENV": "production",
        }
      }
  ]
}
```

Here the default environment is in the `env`, but you can decide to use `env_production` by using `pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --env production`.

You can define as many environments as you like, just remember that you must pass the name of the environment (after `env_`) you want to use with `--env`.

## Specific environment variables

### NODE_APP_INSTANCE (PM2 2.5 minimum)

There is the `NODE_APP_INSTANCE` environment variable that is used to make a difference between process, for example you may want to run a cronjob only on one process, you can just check if `process.env.NODE_APP_INSTANCE === '0'`.
Two processes can never have the same number, its still true after `pm2 restart` and `pm2 scale` commands.

You may have problems with [node-config](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/issues/2045) with the `NODE_APP_INSTANCE` name, so you can rename it with `instance_var` options :

```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps : [
      {
        name: "myapp",
        script: "./app.js",
        watch: true,
        instance_var: 'INSTANCE_ID',
        env: {
            "PORT": 3000,
            "NODE_ENV": "development"
        }
      }
  ]
}
```

In this case the variable will have the same behavior but will be in `process.env.INSTANCE_ID`.

#### increment_var (PM2 2.5 minimum)

There is an option to ask PM2 to increment a environment variable for each instance launched, for example:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps : [
      {
        name: "myapp",
        script: "./app.js",
        instances: 2,
        exec_mode: "cluster",
        watch: true,
        increment_var : 'PORT',
        env: {
            "PORT": 3000,
            "NODE_ENV": "development"
        }
      }
  ]
}
```

In this example, if i run `pm2 start ecosystem.config.js` :
 - PM2 will see that i want to increment the `PORT` variable for each instance
 - It will see that i have defined the default to `3000`
 - The first instance will have `process.env.PORT = 3000` and the second `process.env.PORT = 3001`

**NOTE** : It will increment also when scaling using `pm2 scale myapp 4`, both new instances will have `3002` and `3003` as `PORT` variable.


If you just want a fresh install of PM2 without setting up Node.Js, pm2 is available as a `.deb` package!

It is built to work with the latest Long Term Support release of ubuntu.

## Installation

```bash
# 1. Add the PM2 repository signing key
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv D1EA2D4C

# 2. Add the PM2 repository
echo "deb http://apt.pm2.io/ubuntu stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pm2.list

# 3. Update list of available packages
sudo apt-get update

# 4. Install PM2
sudo apt-get install pm2
```





## Application Logs

Once an application is started with PM2 you can consult and manage logs easily.

Log files are located in the folder `$HOME/.pm2/logs`.

### Log Views

To display application's log you can use the command `pm2 logs`

```bash
-l --log [path]              specify filepath to output both out and error logs
-o --output <path>           specify out log file
-e --error <path>            specify error log file
--time                       prefix logs with standard formatted timestamp
--log-date-format <format>   prefix logs with custom formatted timestamp
--log-type <type>            specify log output style (raw by default, or json)
--merge-logs                 when running multiple process with same app name, do not split file by id
```

  Usage: logs [options] [id|name|namespace]

  stream logs file. Default stream all logs

  Options:

    --json                json log output
    --format              formatted log output
    --raw                 raw output
    --err                 only shows error output
    --out                 only shows standard output
    --lines <n>           output the last N lines, instead of the last 15 by default
    --timestamp [format]  add timestamps (default format YYYY-MM-DD-HH:mm:ss)
    --nostream            print logs without launching the log stream
    --highlight [value]   highlights the given value
    -h, --help            output usage information
```

Some important commands:

```bash
# Display all apps logs in realtime
pm2 logs

# Display only `api` application logs
pm2 logs api

# Display new logs in json
pm2 logs --json

# Display 1000 lines of api log file
pm2 logs big-api --lines 1000
```

You can also check logs with the CLI dashboard:

```bash
pm2 logs --json
```

For each application line this metadata will be printed:

```json
{
   "message": "echo\n",                     // the actual message that has been `console.log`
   "timestamp": "2017-02-06T14:51:38.896Z", // timestamp of the message, can be formatted
   "type": "out",                           // the type of logs, can be `err`, `out` or `PM2`
   "process_id": 0,                         // the process id used by PM2
   "app_name": "one-echo"                   // the application name
}
```

## Log size limit

The module [pm2-logrotate](https://github.com/keymetrics/pm2-logrotate) automatically rotate and keep all the logs file using a limited space on disk.

To install it:

```bash
pm2 install pm2-logrotate
```

Read more about pm2-logrotate [here](https://github.com/pm2-hive/pm2-logrotate#configure)

## Flushing logs

This will empty the current application logs managed by PM2:

```bash
pm2 flush

pm2 flush <api> # Clear the logs for the app with name/id matching <api>
```

## Application log options

When starting an application you can specify many options on how 

### CLI

When running `pm2 start app.js [OPTIONS]` you can pass any of this options to the CLI:

```bash
-l --log [path]              specify filepath to output both out and error logs
-o --output <path>           specify out log file
-e --error <path>            specify error log file
--time                       prefix logs with standard formatted timestamp
--log-date-format <format>   prefix logs with custom formatted timestamp
--merge-logs                 when running multiple process with same app name, do not split file by id
```

### Configuration file

Via configuration file you can pass the options:

|    Field |   Type  |  Example |  Description|
|:----------|:-------:|:------------------------------:|:-------------------------|
|error_file| (string)| | error file path (default to $HOME/.pm2/logs/&lt;app name&gt;-error-&lt;pid&gt;.log)|
|out_file| (string) | | output file path (default to $HOME/.pm2/logs/&lt;app name&gt;-out-&lt;pid&gt;.log)|
|log_file| (string) | | file path for both output and error logs (disabled by default)|
|pid_file| (string) | | pid file path (default to $HOME/.pm2/pids/&lt;app name&gt;-&lt;pid&gt;.pid)|
|merge_logs| boolean | true | if set to true, avoid to suffix logs file with the process id  |
|log_date_format| (string) | "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm Z" | log date format (see log section)|

### Disabling log suffix
 
For app in cluster mode (node.js) only;
If you want that all instances of a clustered process logs into the same file you can use the option `--merge-logs` or `merge_logs: true` 

### Disable logging

To disable all logs to be written in disk you can set the option `out_file` and `error_file` to `/dev/null`

```js
module.exports = {
  apps : [{
    name: 'Business News Watcher',
    script: 'app.js',
    instances: 1,
    out_file: "/dev/null",
    error_file: "/dev/null"
    cron_restart: '0 0 * * *'
    [...]
  }]
}
```

You can provide `/dev/null` or `NULL` as output of logs (not depending on the platform, they are a hardcoded string).

### Setting up a native logrotate

```bash
sudo pm2 logrotate -u user
```

This will write a basic logrotate configuration to `/etc/logrotate.d/pm2-user` that will look like this:

```
/home/user/.pm2/pm2.log /home/user/.pm2/logs/*.log {
        rotate 12
        weekly
        missingok
        notifempty
        compress
        delaycompress
        create 0640 user user
}
```


## Max Memory Threshold Auto Reload

PM2 allows to reload (auto fallback to restart if not in cluster) an application based on a memory limit/ Please note that the PM2 internal worker (which checks memory), starts every 30 seconds, so you may have to wait a bit before your process gets restarted automatically after reaching the memory threshold.

CLI:

```bash
pm2 start api.js --max-memory-restart 300M
```

Config file (ecosystem.config.js):

```bash
module.exports = {
  apps: [{
    name: 'api',
    script: 'api.js',
    max_memory_restart: '300M'
  }]
}
```

*Note:* Units can be K(ilobyte), M(egabyte), G(igabyte).


## Monitoring CPU/Memory

<center>
<img src="/images/pm2-monit.png" title="PM2 Monit"/>
</center>

PM2 gives you a simple way to monitor the resource usage of your application.
You can monitor memory and CPU easily and straight from your terminal:

```bash
pm2 monit
```

## PM2.io

If you manage your Node.js application with PM2, we invite you to try [PM2.io](https://pm2.io). It makes monitoring and managing applications across servers easier than ever.

Feel free to try it:
[Discover the monitoring dashboard for PM2](https://app.pm2.io/#/register)


## PM2 API

PM2 can be used programmatically, allowing to manage processes straight from the code.

## Quickstart

**Note**: To release connection to PM2 and make your application auto exit, make sure to disconnect from pm2 with `pm2.disconnect()`

First add PM2 as a dependency:

```bash
npm install pm2 --save
```

Then create a script called app.js and pm2-control.js containing this:

```javascript
const pm2 = require('pm2')

pm2.connect(function(err) {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err)
    process.exit(2)
  }

  pm2.start({
    script    : 'api.js',
    name      : 'api'
  }, function(err, apps) {
    if (err) {
      console.error(err)
      return pm2.disconnect()
    }

    pm2.list((err, list) => {
      console.log(err, list)

      pm2.restart('api', (err, proc) => {
        // Disconnects from PM2
        pm2.disconnect()
      })
    })
  })
})
```

- This will spawn or connect to local PM2
- Then start app.js with name **api**
- Display all applications managed with PM2
- Then restart the app with name **api**
- And disconnect from PM2

### API Methods

|    Param |   Type  |    Description |
|----------|---------|----------------|
|process    | string/number   | target process ID or Name|
|fn    | function   | Callback|

#### pm2.killDaemon(fn)

Kills the pm2 daemon (same as **pm2 kill**). Note that when the daemon is killed, all its processes are also killed. Also note that you still have to explicitly disconnect from the daemon even after you kill it.

#### pm2.describe(process, fn)

**`pm2.connect(errback)`** - Either connects to a running pm2 daemon ("God") or launches and daemonizes one. Once launched, the pm2 process will keep running after the script exits.  
**`pm2.connect(noDaemonMode, errback)`**

* `noDaemonMode` - (Default: false) If true is passed for the first argument, pm2 will not be run as a daemon and will die when the related script exits. By default, pm2 stays alive after your script exits. If pm2 is already running, your script will link to the existing daemon but will die once your process exits.
* `errback(error)` - Called when finished connecting to or launching the pm2 daemon process.

**`pm2.start(options, errback)`** - Starts a script that will be managed by pm2.  
**`pm2.start(jsonConfigFile, errback)`**  
**`pm2.start(script, errback)`**  
**`pm2.start(script, options, errback)`**  
**`pm2.start(script, jsonConfigFile, errback)`**  

* `script` - The path of the script to run.
* `jsonConfigFile` - The path to a JSON file that can contain the same options as the `options` parameter.
* `errback(err,proc)` - An errback called when the `script` has been started. The `proc` parameter will be a [pm2 process object](https://github.com/soyuka/pm2-notify#templating).
* `options` - An object with the following options (additional descriptions of these options are [here](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/pm2-doc-single-page/#graceful-reload)):
  * `name` - An arbitrary name that can be used to interact with (e.g. restart) the process later in other commands. Defaults to the script name without its extension (eg `"testScript"` for `"testScript.js"`).
  * `script` - The path of the script to run.
  * `args` - A string or array of strings composed of arguments to pass to the script.
  * `interpreterArgs` - A string or array of strings composed of arguments to call the interpreter process with. Eg "--harmony" or ["--harmony","--debug"]. Only applies if `interpreter` is something other than "none" (its "node" by default).
  * `cwd` - The working directory to start the process with.
  * `output` - (Default: `"~/.pm2/logs/app_name-out.log"`) The path to a file to append stdout output to. Can be the same file as `error`.
  * `error` - (Default: `"~/.pm2/logs/app_name-error.err"`) The path to a file to append stderr output to. Can be the same file as `output`.
  * `logDateFormat` - The display format for log timestamps (eg "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm Z"). The format is a [moment display format](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/).
  * `pid` - (Default: `"~/.pm2/pids/app_name-id.pid"`) The path to a file to write the pid of the started process. The file will be overwritten. Note that the file is not used in any way by pm2 and so the user is free to manipulate or remove that file at any time. The file will be deleted when the process is stopped or the daemon killed.
  * `minUptime` - The minimum uptime of the script before it's considered successfully started. 
  * `maxRestarts` - The maximum number of times in a row a script will be restarted if it exits in less than `min_uptime`.
  * `maxMemoryRestart` - If sets and `script`'s memory usage goes about the configured number, pm2 restarts the `script`. Uses human-friendly suffixes: 'K' for kilobytes, 'M' for megabytes, 'G' for gigabytes', etc. Eg "150M".
  * `killTimeout` - (Default: `1600`) The number of milliseconds to wait after a `stop` or `restart` command issues a `SIGINT` signal to kill the script forcibly with a `SIGKILL` signal. 
  * `restartDelay` - (Default: `0`) Number of milliseconds to wait before restarting a script that has exited.  
  * `interpreter` - (Default: `'node'`) The interpreter for your script (eg "python", "ruby", "bash", etc). The value "none" will execute the 'script' as a binary executable.
  * `execMode` - (Default: `'fork'`) If sets to 'cluster', will enable clustering (running multiple instances of the `script`). [See here for more details](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/cluster-mode/).
  * `instances` - (*Default: `1`*) How many instances of `script` to create. Only relevant in `exec_mode` 'cluster'.
  * `mergeLogs` - (Default: `false`) If true, merges the log files for all instances of `script` into one stderr log and one stdout log. Only applies in 'cluster' mode. For example, if you have 4 instances of 'test.js' started via pm2, normally you would have 4 stdout log files and 4 stderr log files, but with this option set to true you would only have one stdout file and one stderr file.
  * `watch` - If set to `true`, the application will be restarted on change of the `script` file.
  * `force` (Default: `false`) By default, pm2 will only start a script if that script isn't already running (a script is a path to an application, not the name of an application already running). If `force` is set to true, pm2 will start a new instance of that script.
  * `autorestart` (Default `true`).  If `false`, pm2 will *not* attempt to restart it following successful completion or process failure.
  * `cron`
  * `executeCommand`
  * `write`
  * `sourceMapSupport`
  * `disableSourceMapSupport`

const pm2 = require('pm2')

pm2.connect(function() {
  pm2.sendDataToProcessId({
    // id of process from "pm2 list" command or from pm2.list(errback) method
    id   : 1,

    // process:msg will be send as 'message' on target process
    type : 'process:msg',

    // Data to be sent
    data : {
      some : 'data'
    },
    id   : 0, // id of process from "pm2 list" command or from pm2.list(errback) method
    topic: 'some topic'
  }, function(err, res) {
  })
})

// Listen to messages from application
pm2.launchBus(function(err, pm2_bus) {
  pm2_bus.on('process:msg', function(packet) {
    console.log(packet)
  })
})
```

pm2-app.js:

```javascript
process.on('message', function(packet) {
  process.send({
    type : 'process:msg',
    data : {
     success : true
    }
 });
});
```


PM2 comes with a handy development tool that allow you to start an application and restart it on file change:

```bash
# Start your application in development mode
# it print the logs and restart on file change too

# Two way of running your application :
pm2-dev start my-app.js

# or

pm2-dev my-app.js
```


## Expose RPC Methods: Process Actions

Exposing RPC Methods will allow you to interact in real-time with a running process.

This is useful for:
- Changing behavior (e.g. switching log to debug)
- Retrieving data structure
- Triggering actions

### Quick Start

First install [tx2](https://github.com/pm2/tx2) module:

```bash
$ npm install tx2
```

Then create an application called rpc.js:

```javascript
const tx2 = require('tx2')

tx2.action('hello', (reply) => {
  reply({ answer : 'world' })
i})

setInterval(function() {
  // Keep application online
}, 100)
```

And start it with PM2:

```bash
$ pm2 start rpc.js
```

Now to trigger process actions, use the command:

```bash
$ pm2 trigger <application-name> <action-name>
# pm2 trigger rpc hello
```

### Listing available RPC methods

To list all available RPC methods:

```bash
pm2 show <application-name>
# pm2 show rpc
```

### Passing a parameter

To pass a parameter to the remote function, just add the `param` attribute to the callback:

```javascript
var tx2 = require('tx2')

tx2.action('world', function(param, reply) {
  console.log(param)
  reply({success : param})
})
```

Restart your application and call this process function with PM2:

```bash
pm2 trigger <application-name> <action-name> [parameter]
# pm2 trigger rpc world somedata
```

### Triggering from Web Dashboard

All RPC methods exposed from your application, once connected to [pm2.io](https://app.pm2.io) will be displayed and actionable from a web interface.

## TX2 API Documentation

[https://github.com/pm2/tx2/blob/main/API.md](https://github.com/pm2/tx2/blob/main/API.md)


## Managing applications states

With PM2 you can easily start/restart/reload/stop/list applications in background.

### Start

To start an application:

```bash
$ pm2 start api.js
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/757747/123512784-b0341900-d689-11eb-93d4-69510ee2be27.png)

You can also start any kind of application like bash commands, script, binaries:

```bash
$ pm2 start "npm run start"
$ pm2 start "ls -la"
$ pm2 start app.py
```

#### Start and display log stream

To start an app and check logs stream use the `--attach` option:

```bash
$ pm2 start api.js --attach
```

When quitting via Ctrl-C, the app will still run in background.

#### Passing arguments

All option passed after `--` will be passed as argument to the app:

```bash
$ pm2 start api.js -- arg1 arg2
```
#### Configuration File

When managing multiple application at the same time or having to specify multiple options, you can use a configuration file.
Example with this ecosystem.config.js file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps : [{
    name   : "limit worker",
    script : "./worker.js",
    args   : "limit"
  },{
    name   : "rotate worker",
    script : "./worker.js",
    args   : "rotate"
  }]
}
```

Then to start both apps:

```bash
$ pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

Read more about [configuration file](/docs/usage/application-declaration/).

### Restart

To restart an application:

```bash
$ pm2 restart api
```

To restart all applications:

```bash
$ pm2 restart all
```

#### Updating environment variables and options

To update environment variables or PM2 options, specify the `--update-env` CLI option:

```bash
$ NODE_ENV=production pm2 restart web-interface --update-env
```

### Stop

To stop a specified application:

```bash
$ pm2 stop api
$ pm2 stop [process_id]
```

To stop them all:

```bash
$ pm2 stop all
```

Note: this will not delete the application from PM2 application list. See next section to delete an application.

### Delete

To stop and delete an application:

```bash
$ pm2 delete api
```

To delete them all:

```bash
$ pm2 delete all
```

## Listing Applications

To list all running applications:

```bash
$ pm2 list
# Or
$ pm2 [list|ls|l|status]
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/757747/123511260-a3f78e00-d680-11eb-8907-3f1017ef7dc8.png)


To specify which order you want the application to be listed:

```bash
$ pm2 list --sort name:desc
# Or
$ pm2 list --sort [name|id|pid|memory|cpu|status|uptime][:asc|desc]
```

### Terminal Dashboard

PM2 gives you a simple way to monitor the resource usage of your application.
You can monitor memory and CPU easily and straight from your terminal with:

```bash
pm2 monit
```

<center>
<img src="/images/pm2-monit.png" title="PM2 Monit"/>
</center>


### Showing application metadata

To display metadata about an application:

```bash
$ pm2 show api
```

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/757747/123510635-fafb6400-d67c-11eb-8534-0ce6106979b2.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/>

### Reset restart count

To reset the restart counter:

```bash
$ pm2 reset all
```


## Expose Metrics

By plugging custom metrics onto your code, you will be able to monitor in-code values, in realtime.

### Quick Start

First install [tx2](https://github.com/pm2/tx2) module:

```bash
$ npm install tx2
```

Then create and app called monit.js:

```javascript
const tx2 = require('tx2')
const http = require('http')

let meter = tx2.meter({
  name      : 'req/sec',
  samples   : 1,
  timeframe : 60
})

http.createServer((req, res) => {
  meter.mark()
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'})
  res.write('Hello World!')
  res.end()
}).listen(6001)
```

And start it with PM2:

```bash
$ pm2 start monit.js
```

Now show the metrics with the command:

```bash
$ pm2 show [app]
# pm2 show monit
```

*Note*: metrics are in the section "Custom Metrics".

<img src="/images/processmetrics.png" title="custom metrics" width="600"/>


or you can use the Terminal based interface:

```bash
$ pm2 monit
```

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WHDEvHg.png" title="custom metrics" width="300"/>

## Metrics helper available

Then you can program your very own metrics to track important information. 4 different probes are available:

- **Simple metrics**: Values that can be read instantly
    - eg. Monitor variable value
- **Counter**: Things that increment or decrement
    - eg. Downloads being processed, user connected
- **Meter**: Things that are measured as events / interval
    - eg. Request per minute for a http server
- **Histogram**: Keeps a reservoir of statistically relevant values biased towards the last 5 minutes to explore their distribution
    - eg. Monitor the mean of execution of a query into database


### API Documentation

**Note**: Refer to the [TX2 API Documentation](https://github.com/pm2/tx2/blob/main/API.md)

### Examples

#### Simple Metric: Simple value reporting

This allows to expose values that can be read instantly.

```javascript
const tx2 = require('tx2')

// Here the value function will be called each second to get the value
var metric = tx2.metric({
  name    : 'Realtime user',
  value   : function() {
    return Object.keys(users).length
  }
})

// Here we are going to call valvar.set() to set the new value
var valvar = tx2.metric({
  name    : 'Realtime Value'
})

valvar.set(23)
```

#### Counter: Sequential value change

Values that increment or decrement.

Example to count Active Http Requests:

```javascript
const tx2 = require('tx2')
var http = require('http')

var counter = tx2.counter({
  name : 'Active requests'
})

http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  counter.inc()

  req.on('end', function() {
    // Decrement the counter, counter will eq 0
    counter.dec()
  })
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'})
  res.write('Hello World!')
  res.end()
}).listen(6001)
```

#### Meter: Average calculated values

Values that are measured as events / interval.

Example to count number of queries per minute:

```javascript
const tx2 = require('tx2')
var http = require('http')

var meter = tx2.meter({
  name      : 'req/sec',
  samples   : 1,
  timeframe : 60
})

http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  meter.mark()
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'})
  res.write('Hello World!')
  res.end()
}).listen(6001)
```

##### Options

**samples** option is the rate unit. Defaults to **1** sec.
**timeframe** option is the timeframe over which events will be analyzed. Defaults to **60** sec.

#### Histogram

Keeps a reservoir of statistically relevant values biased towards the last 5 minutes to explore their distribution.

```javascript
const tx2 = require('tx2')

var histogram = tx2.histogram({
  name        : 'latency',
  measurement : 'mean'
})

var latency = 0

setInterval(function() {
  latency = Math.round(Math.random() * 100)
  histogram.update(latency)
}, 100)
```


## Restart strategies

When starting application with PM2, application are automatically restarted on auto exit, event loop empty (node.js) or when application crash.
But you can also configure extra restart strategies like:

A new restart mode has been implemented on PM2 Runtime, making your application restarts in a smarter way. Instead of restarting your application like crazy when exceptions happens (e.g. database is down), the *exponential backoff restart* will increase incrementally the time between restarts, reducing the pressure on your DB or your external provider... Pretty easy to use:

```bash
$ pm2 start app.js --cron-restart="0 0 * * *"
# Or when restarting an app
$ pm2 restart app --cron-restart="0 0 * * *"
```

Via configuration file, use the `cron_restart` attribute:

```bash
module.exports = {
  apps : [{
    name: 'Business News Watcher',
    script: 'app.js',
    instances: 1,
    cron_restart: '0 0 * * *',
    env: {
      NODE_ENV: 'development'
    },
    env_production: {
      NODE_ENV: 'production'
    }
  }]
}
```

## Restart on file change

PM2 can automatically restart your application when a file is modified in the current directory or its subdirectories:

Via CLI:

```bash
$ pm2 start app.js --watch
```

*Note*: If an application is started with the `--watch` option, stopping the app will not prevent it to be restarted on file change.
To totally disable the watch feature, do: `pm2 stop app --watch` or toggle the watch option on application restart via `pm2 restart app --watch`.

Via configuration file, use the `watch: true` attribute:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  script: "app.js",
  watch: true
}
```

You can specify which folder to watch for change, ignore folder and watch files interval with these options:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  script: "app.js",
  // Specify which folder to watch
  watch: ["server", "client"],
  // Specify delay between watch interval
  watch_delay: 1000,
  // Specify which folder to ignore 
  ignore_watch : ["node_modules", "client/img"],
}
```

## Memory based restart strategy

PM2 allows to reload (auto fallback to restart if not in cluster) an application based on a memory limit/ Please note that the PM2 internal worker (which checks memory), starts every 30 seconds, so you may have to wait a bit before your process gets restarted automatically after reaching the memory threshold.

CLI:

```bash
$ pm2 start api.js --max-memory-restart 300M
```

Via configuration file, use the `max_memory_restart` attribute:

```bash
module.exports = {
  script: 'api.js',
  max_memory_restart: '300M'
}
```

Note: Units can be K(ilobyte) (e.g. `512K`), M(egabyte) (e.g. `128M`), G(igabyte) (e.g. `1G`).

## Restart Delay

Set a delay between auto restart with the Restart Delay strategy:

CLI:

```bash
$ pm2 start app.js --restart-delay=3000
```

Via configuration file, use the `restart_delay` attribute:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  script: 'app.js',
  restart_delay: 3000
}
```

## No Auto Restart

This is useful in case we wish to run 1-time scripts and don't want the process manager to restart our script in case it's completed running.

CLI:

```bash
$ pm2 start app.js --no-autorestart
```

Via configuration file, use the `autorestart` attribute:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  script: 'app.js',
  autorestart: false
}
```

## Skip Auto Restart For Specific Exit Codes

Sometimes you might want the application to automatically restart in case of failure (i.e. non-zero exit code),
while not wanting the process manager to restart it when it shuts down properly (i.e. exit code equal to 0).

In this case, you can still use PM2 just fine with a `stop_exit_codes` option set to exit codes that should skip auto restart:

CLI:

```bash
$ pm2 start app.js --stop-exit-codes 0
```

Or via configuration file, use the `stop_exit_codes` attribute:

```javascript
module.exports = [{
  script: 'app.js',
  stop_exit_codes: [0]
}]
```

## Exponential Backoff Restart Delay

A new restart mode has been implemented on PM2 Runtime, making your application restarts in a smarter way. Instead of restarting your application like crazy when exceptions happens (e.g. database is down), the *exponential backoff restart* will increase incrementally the time between restarts, reducing the pressure on your DB or your external provider... Pretty easy to use:

CLI:

```bash
$ pm2 start app.js --exp-backoff-restart-delay=100
```

Via configuration file, use the `exp_backoff_restart_delay` attribute:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  script: 'app.js',
  exp_backoff_restart_delay: 100
}
```

When an application crash unexpectedly and the option `--exp-backoff-restart-delay` is activated, you will be able to see a new application status **waiting restart**.

By running `pm2 logs` you will also see the restart delay being incremented:
```
PM2      | App [throw:0] will restart in 100ms
PM2      | App [throw:0] exited with code [1] via signal [SIGINT]
PM2      | App [throw:0] will restart in 150ms
PM2      | App [throw:0] exited with code [1] via signal [SIGINT]
PM2      | App [throw:0] will restart in 225ms
```

As you can see the restart delay between restarts will increase in an exponential moving average, till reaching the maximum of 15000ms between restarts.

When the application will then get back to a stable mode (uptime without restarts of more than 30 seconds), the restart delay will automatically reset to 0ms.


## Serve static file over http

PM2 can serve static file very easily with the `pm2 serve` feature.
It support serving raw files from a specified folder or you can serve a SPA (Single Page Application) with it.

## CLI

Serve your static files (like a frontend app) over http with a simple command :

```bash
pm2 serve <path> <port>
```

The current folder will be used if you don't precise `<path>`, for the port the default one is `8080`.
You can use the same options as a normal application like `--name` or `--watch`.

## Process file

You can declare in a process file that you want a special dir to be served, to do so :

```javascript
module.exports = {
  script: "serve",
  env: {
    PM2_SERVE_PATH: '.',
    PM2_SERVE_PORT: 8080
  }
}
```

You just need to add `PM2_SERVE_PATH` and `PM2_SERVE_PORT` to env variables to specify the path and the port, the default are the same as the CLI.

## Serving SPA: redirect all to index.html

To automatically redirect all queries to the index.html use the `--spa` option:

```bash
pm2 serve --spa
```

Via a process file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  script: "serve",
  env: {
    PM2_SERVE_PATH: '.',
    PM2_SERVE_PORT: 8080,
    PM2_SERVE_SPA: 'true',
    PM2_SERVE_HOMEPAGE: './index.html'
  }
}
```

### Protect access with password

To basic protect the access to the exposed files you can use the `--basic-auth-username` and `--basic-auth-password`:

```bash
pm2 serve --basic-auth-username <username> --basic-auth-password <password>
```

Via a process file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  script: "serve",
  env: {
    PM2_SERVE_PATH: '.',
    PM2_SERVE_PORT: 8080,
    PM2_SERVE_BASIC_AUTH: 'true',
    PM2_SERVE_BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME: 'example-login',
    PM2_SERVE_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD: 'example-password'
  }
}
```



## CLI completion

Tab-completion for PM2:

```bash
pm2 completion install
```

Or manually append completion script to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc file:

```bash
pm2 completion >> ~/.bashrc # or ~/.zshrc
```

Then source your .bashrc or .zshrc file for current session:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc # or ~/.zshrc
```

You can add pm2 completion to your current session this way:

```bash
. <(pm2 completion)
```


## Graceful Stop

To allow graceful restart/reload/stop processes, make sure you intercept the **SIGINT** signal and clear everything needed (like database connections, processing jobs...) before letting your application exit.

```javascript
process.on('SIGINT', function() {
   db.stop(function(err) {
     process.exit(err ? 1 : 0)
   })
})
```

Now `pm2 reload` will become a gracefulReload.

### Configure the kill timeout

Via CLI, this will lengthen the timeout to 3000ms:

```bash
pm2 start app.js --kill-timeout 3000
```

Via [application declaration](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/application-declaration/) use the `kill_timeout` attribute:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps : [{
    name: 'app',
    script: './app.js',
    kill_timeout : 3000
  }]
}
```

## Graceful start

Sometimes you might need to wait for your application to have established connections with your DBs/caches/workers/whatever. PM2 needs to wait before considering your application as `online`. To do this, you need to provide `--wait-ready` to the CLI or provide `wait_ready: true` in a process file. This will make PM2 listen for that event. In your application you will need to add `process.send('ready');` when you want your application to be considered as ready.

```javascript
var http = require('http')

var app = http.createServer(function(req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200)
  res.end('hey')
})

var listener = app.listen(0, function() {
  console.log('Listening on port ' + listener.address().port)
  // Here we send the ready signal to PM2
  process.send('ready')
})
```

Then start the application:

```bash
pm2 start app.js --wait-ready
```

### Configure the ready timeout

By default, PM2 wait 3000ms for the `ready` signal.

Via CLI, this will lengthen the timeout to 10000ms:

```bash
pm2 start app.js --wait-ready --listen-timeout 10000
```

Via [application declaration](/docs/usage/application-declaration/) use the `listen_timeout` and `wait_ready` attribute:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps : [{
    name: 'app',
    script: './app.js',
    wait_ready: true,
    listen_timeout: 10000
  }]
}
```

### Graceful start using http.Server.listen

There is still the default system that hooks into `http.Server.listen` method. When your http server accepts a connection, it will automatically state your application as ready. You can increase the PM2 waiting time the listen using the same variable as `--wait-ready` graceful start : `listen_timeout` entry in process file or `--listen-timeout=XXXX` via CLI.

## Explanation: Signals flow

When a process is stopped/restarted by PM2, some system signals are sent to your process in a given order.

First a **SIGINT** a signal is sent to your processes, signal you can catch to know that your process is going to be stopped. If your application does not exit by itself before 1.6s *([customizable](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/signals-clean-restart/#customize-exit-delay))* it will receive a **SIGKILL** signal to force the process exit.

The signal **SIGINT** can be replaced on any other signal (e.g. **SIGTERM**) by setting environment variable **PM2_KILL_SIGNAL**.

## Windows graceful stop

When signals are not available your process gets killed. In that case you have to use `--shutdown-with-message` via CLI or `shutdown_with_message` in Ecosystem File and listen for `shutdown` events.

Via CLI:

```bash
pm2 start app.js --shutdown-with-message
```

Via [application declaration](/docs/usage/application-declaration/) use the `listen_timeout` and `wait_ready` attribute:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps : [{
    name: 'app',
    script: './app.js',
    shutdown_with_message: true
  }]
}
```

Listen for `shutdown` events

```javascript
process.on('message', function(msg) {
  if (msg == 'shutdown') {
    console.log('Closing all connections...')
    setTimeout(function() {
      console.log('Finished closing connections')
      process.exit(0)
    }, 1500)
  }
})
```


If you use [BabelJS](https://babeljs.io/), [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) or any other Javascript superset you may have noticed that when an exception occurs, the stacktrace is not meaningful at all. To get interesting information you need to generate [source map files](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/).

Once these source map files are generated, PM2 will automatically detect them and will help you inspect errors.

## Source map

Since the version 1.0.2, PM2 embeds a mechanism to support javascript source map.

**PM2 automatically detects javascript source map files** if you start app.js, it will expect app.js.map to exist as well.

If you have a different layout, you can force source map support by starting your application:

Via CLI:

```bash
pm2 start app.js --source-map-support
```

Or via JSON file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
   name: 'babel-app',
   script: 'app.js',
   source_map_support: true
}
```

### Inspect exceptions

Exceptions are logged into your application error log file.

To check your logs to detect exceptions, you can type:

```bash
pm2 logs main
```

Otherwise, use [keymetrics.io](https://keymetrics.io/) to have a clean listing and notifications of [new alerts](http://docs.keymetrics.io/docs/pages/issues/).

### Disable source map support

If you do not want PM2 to automatically support javascript source maps you can use the option `--disable-source-map-support`.

This is supported both via CLI and via a JSON file.


## Listening on port 80 w/o root

It’s a general rule that you should not run node as root. However only root can bind to ports less than 1024. This is where authbind comes in. Authbind allows non-root users to bind to ports less than 1024. Replace `%user%` with the user that will be running `pm2`.

```bash
sudo apt-get install authbind
sudo touch /etc/authbind/byport/80
sudo chown %user% /etc/authbind/byport/80
sudo chmod 755 /etc/authbind/byport/80
```

You should also add an alias to the user that runs `pm2` profile, e.g. `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` (note you will need to run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` immediately after):

```diff
+alias pm2='authbind --deep pm2'
```

Finally ensure that `pm2` is updated with `authbind`:

```sh
authbind --deep pm2 update
```

Or simply `pm2 update` if you added the alias to your user's profile.

Now you can start applications using PM2 that can bind to port 80 without being root!

## Multiple PM2 on the same server

The client and daemon communicate via socket files available in $HOME/.pm2/pub.sock and $HOME/.pm2/rpc.sock.

You can start multiple PM2 instances by changing the `PM2_HOME` environment variable.

```bash
PM2_HOME='.pm2' pm2 start echo.js --name="echo-node-1"
PM2_HOME='.pm3' pm2 start echo.js --name="echo-node-2"
```

This will start two different PM2 instances. To list processes managed by each different instances do:

```bash
PM2_HOME='.pm2' pm2 list
PM2_HOME='.pm3' pm2 list
```

## Launch PM2 in no daemon

Make sure you kill any PM2 instance before starting PM2 in no daemon mode (`pm2 kill`).

Launching PM2 without daemonizing itself:

```bash
pm2 start app.js --no-daemon
```

There is also the CLI `pm2-runtime` installed by default at PM2 installation, that is a drop-in replacement of the Node.js binary.

## Stateless apps

It is a general rule that your production application should be stateless. Every data, states, websocket session, session data, must be shared via any kind of database or PUB/SUB system.

If not, your application will be painful to scale on the same server and across multiple servers.

For example you could use [connect-redis](https://github.com/visionmedia/connect-redis) to share sessions.

We also recommend you to follow the 12 factor convention: [http://12factor.net/](http://12factor.net/)

## Setup pm2 on a server

[How To Use pm2 to Setup a Node.js Production Environment On An Ubuntu VPS](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-use-pm2-to-setup-a-node-js-production-environment-on-an-ubuntu-vps).

## Log and PID files

By default, logs (error and output), pid files, dumps, and PM2 logs are located in `~/.pm2/`:

```
.pm2/
├── dump.pm2
├── custom_options.sh
├── pm2.log
├── pm2.pid
├── logs
└── pids
```

## Enabling Harmony ES6

The `--node-args` option allows the addition of arguments to the node interpreter. To enable harmony for a process type the following command:

```bash
pm2 start my_app.js --node-args="--harmony"
```

And within a JSON declaration:

```json
[{
  "name" : "ES6",
  "script" : "es6.js",
  "node_args" : "--harmony"
}]
```

## CoffeeScript

### CoffeeScript v1

```bash
pm2 install coffee-script 
pm2 start app.coffee
```

### CoffeeScript v2
```bash
pm2 install coffeescript
pm2 start app.coffee
```

That's all!

## Persistent applications: Startup Script Generator

PM2 can generate startup scripts and configure them in order to keep your process list intact across expected or unexpected machine restarts.

### Generating a Startup Script

To automatically generate and configuration a startup script just type the command (without sudo) `pm2 startup`:

```bash
$ pm2 startup
[PM2] You have to run this command as root. Execute the following command:
      sudo su -c "env PATH=$PATH:/home/unitech/.nvm/versions/node/v14.3/bin pm2 startup <distribution> -u <user> --hp <home-path>
```

Then copy/paste the displayed command onto the terminal:

```bash
sudo su -c "env PATH=$PATH:/home/unitech/.nvm/versions/node/v14.3/bin pm2 startup <distribution> -u <user> --hp <home-path>
```

Now PM2 will automatically restart at boot.

**Note**: You can customize the service name via the `--service-name <name>` option ([#3213](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/pull/3213))

### Saving the app list to be restored at reboot

Once you have started all desired apps, save the app list so it will respawn after reboot:

```bash
pm2 save
```

### Manually resurrect processes

To manually bring back previously saved processes (via pm2 save):

```bash
pm2 resurrect
```

### Disabling startup system

To disable and remove the current startup configuration:

```bash
pm2 unstartup
```

The previous line code let PM2 detect your platform. Alternatively you can use another specified init system yourself using:

#### Updating startup script after Node.js version upgrade

When you upgrade the local Node.js version, be sure to update the PM2 startup script, so it runs the latest Node.js binary you have installed.

First disable and remove the current startup configuration (copy/paste the output of that command): 

```bash
$ pm2 unstartup
```

Then restore a fresh startup script:

```bash
$ pm2 startup
```

#### User permissions

Let's say you want the startup script to be executed under another user.

Just change the `-u <username>` option and the `--hp <user_home>`:

```bash
pm2 startup ubuntu -u www --hp /home/ubuntu
```

#### Specifying the init system

You can specify the platform you use by yourself if you want to (where platform can be either one of the cited above): 
```
pm2 startup [ubuntu | ubuntu14 | ubuntu12 | centos | centos6 | arch | oracle | amazon | macos | darwin | freebsd | systemd | systemv | upstart | launchd | rcd | openrc]
```

#### SystemD installation checking

```bash
# Check if pm2-<USER> service has been added
$ systemctl list-units
# Check logs
$ journalctl -u pm2-<USER>
# Cat systemd configuration file
$ systemctl cat pm2-<USER>
# Analyze startup
$ systemd-analyze plot > output.svg
```

To wait efficiently that machine is online for PM2 to run:

```
[Unit]
Wants=network-online.target
After=network.target network-online.target

[....]

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target network-online.target
```

#### Windows startup script

To generate a Windows compatible startup script have a look to the excellent [pm2-installer](https://github.com/jessety/pm2-installer)

#### Init systems supported

- **systemd**: Ubuntu >= 16, CentOS >= 7, Arch, Debian >= 7
- **upstart**: Ubuntu <= 14
- **launchd**: Darwin, MacOSx
- **openrc**: Gentoo Linux, Arch Linux
- **rcd**: FreeBSD
- **systemv**: Centos 6, Amazon Linux

These init systems are automatically detected by PM2 with the `pm2 startup` command.





## Updating PM2

Updating PM2 is extremely fast (less than few seconds) and seamless.

### Process to update PM2

Install the latest PM2 version:

```bash
npm install pm2 -g
```

You can now update the in-memory PM2 daemon via command:

```bash
pm2 update
```

### Node.js version upgrade

When you upgrade your Node.js installation, make sure to also update Node.js version starting PM2.

To update the PM2 startup script run:

```bash
$ pm2 unstartup
$ pm2 startup
```




## Using PM2/Keymetrics in AWS Elastic Beanstalk

This page will guide you step by step through the PM2/Keymetrics integration in a Beanstalk environment. We recommend using the [eb cli](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3.html) for easier deployment.

We created a repository for easy testing: [pm2-ebs-demo](https://github.com/keymetrics/pm2-ebs-demo).

## Setup Beanstalk

Go to your application directory and use `eb init` to setup Beanstalk.

We need to make sure Beanstalk will try to launch your application by using `npm start`. To do so, add a file called Procfile at the root of your source bundle to specify the command that starts your application.

./Procfile

```
web: npm start
```

## Integrate PM2

The easiest and less invasive way to monitor your application using PM2 is by requiring it as a npm module. We will simply change the `package.json` structure to let pm2 start the application.
Just add pm2 to your app dependencies: 
`npm install pm2 --save`

Then we will need to change the startup scripts. We call PM2 from the node_modules folder:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "./node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2-runtime app.js",
  "poststart":  "node ./node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 logs"
}
```

 * Customize the `"start"` script to fit your needs.
 * The `"poststart"` script is optional, but allows simple log checking directly on the AWS dashboard.

That's all! Run `eb deploy` to get a PM2 instance on your ElasticBeanstalk instances with minimal overhead.

## Integrate PM2 with Keymetrics
We need to pass two variables to PM2 from the environment to link it with Keymetrics: `KEYMETRICS_PUBLIC` and `KEYMETRICS_SECRET`.

* When creating the environment from the cli:
`eb create --envvars KEYMETRICS_PUBLIC=XXXXX,KEYMETRICS_SECRET=XXXXXX
`
* You can also add those variables in the AWS dashboard in the Software Configuration options.

Then follow-up the pm2 integration procedure, and pm2 will auto-link the application at start.


## Using PM2 on Cloud Providers

You might find yourself in a situation in which you do not have access to the CLI to start your Node.js applications.

In such a situation, pm2 must be added as a dependency and must be called with the start script.

## Prepare your app

### Set your ecosystem file

Generate an `ecosystem.config.js` template with:

```bash
pm2 init
```

Modify the ecosystem file to match your needs:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps : [{
    name: "app",
    script: "./app.js",
    env: {
      NODE_ENV: "development",
    },
    env_production: {
      NODE_ENV: "production",
    }
  }]
}
```

 Learn more about ecosystem file [here](/docs/usage/application-declaration/).
{: .tip}

### Add PM2 as a module

Add pm2 as a dependency to your project.

With npm:

```bash
npm install pm2
```

With yarn:

```bash
yarn add pm2
```

### Start script in package.json

In your `package.json`, modify your `start` script like the following:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "pm2-runtime start ecosystem.config.js --env production"
  }
}
```

## Deploy your app

You can now deploy your application in your cloud providers like you would have done for a regular node.js app.


## Auto restart apps on file change

PM2 can automatically restart your application when a file is modified in the current directory or its subdirectories:

```bash
pm2 start app.js --watch
```

Or via configuration file set the option `watch: true`.

If an application is started with the `--watch` option, stopping the app will not prevent it to be restarted on file change.
To totally disable the watch feature, do: `pm2 stop app --watch` or toggle the watch option on application restart via `pm2 restart app --watch`.

To watch specific paths, please use a [Ecosystem File](/docs/usage/application-declaration/), `watch` can take a string or an array of paths. Default is `true`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps: [{
    script: "app.js",
    watch: ["server", "client"],
    // Delay between restart
    watch_delay: 1000,
    ignore_watch : ["node_modules", "client/img"],
  }]
}
```
