## Getting started

PM2 embeds a simple and powerful deployment system with revision tracing. [Another step by step tutorial here](https://keymetrics.io/2014/06/25/ecosystem-json-deploy-and-iterate-faster/).

Please read the [Considerations to use PM2 deploy](#considerations).

## Simple deploy

Basically you only need to add a "deploy" attribute to the ecosystem.json. Here is a bare minimum to deploy an application:

process.json:

```javascript
{
   "apps" : [{
      "name" : "HTTP-API",
      "script" : "http.js"
   }],
   "deploy" : {
     // "production" is the environment name
     "production" : {
       "user" : "ubuntu",
       "host" : ["192.168.0.13"],
       "ref"  : "origin/master",
       "repo" : "git@github.com:Username/repository.git",
       "path" : "/var/www/my-repository",
       "post-deploy" : "npm install; grunt dist"
      },
   }
}
```

/bin/bash:

```bash
# Setup deployment at remote location
$ pm2 deploy production setup

# Update remote version
$ pm2 deploy production update

# Revert to -1 deployment
$ pm2 deploy production revert 1

# execute command on remote machines
$ pm2 deploy production exec "pm2 reload all"
```

## Complete tutorial

1- Generate a sample ecosystem.json file that lists the processes and the deployment environment.

```bash
pm2 ecosystem
```

In the current folder a `ecosystem.json` file will be created.
It contains this:

```javascript
{
  // Applications part
  "apps" : [{
    "name"      : "API",
    "script"    : "app.js",
    "env": {
      "COMMON_VARIABLE": "true"
    },
    // Environment variables injected when starting with --env production
    // http://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/application-declaration/#switching-to-different-environments
    "env_production" : {
      "NODE_ENV": "production"
    }
  },{
    "name"      : "WEB",
    "script"    : "web.js"
  }],
  // Deployment part
  // Here you describe each environment
  "deploy" : {
    "production" : {
      "user" : "node",
      // Multi host is possible, just by passing IPs/hostname as an array
      "host" : ["212.83.163.1", "212.83.163.2", "212.83.163.3"],
      // Branch
      "ref"  : "origin/master",
      // Git repository to clone
      "repo" : "git@github.com:repo.git",
      // Path of the application on target servers
      "path" : "/var/www/production",
      // Can be used to give options in the format used in the configura-
      // tion file.  This is useful for specifying options for which there
      // is no separate command-line flag, see 'man ssh' 
      // can be either a single string or an array of strings
      "ssh_options": "StrictHostKeyChecking=no",
      // To prepare the host by installing required software (eg: git) 
      // even before the setup process starts
      // can be multiple commands separated by the character ";"
      // or path to a script on your local machine
      "pre-setup" : "apt-get install git",
      // Commands / path to a script on the host machine
      // This will be executed on the host after cloning the repository
      // eg: placing configurations in the shared dir etc
      "post-setup": "ls -la",
      // Commands to execute locally (on the same machine you deploy things)
      // Can be multiple commands separated by the character ";"
      "pre-deploy-local" : "echo 'This is a local executed command'"
      // Commands to be executed on the server after the repo has been cloned
      "post-deploy" : "npm install && pm2 startOrRestart ecosystem.json --env production"
      // Environment variables that must be injected in all applications on this env
      "env"  : {
        "NODE_ENV": "production"
      }
    },
    "staging" : {
      "user" : "node",
      "host" : "212.83.163.1",
      "ref"  : "origin/master",
      "repo" : "git@github.com:repo.git",
      "path" : "/var/www/development",
      "ssh_options": ["StrictHostKeyChecking=no", "PasswordAuthentication=no"],
      "post-deploy" : "pm2 startOrRestart ecosystem.json --env dev",
      "env"  : {
        "NODE_ENV": "staging"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Edit the file according to your needs.

2- Be sure that you have the public ssh key on your local machine

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
ssh-copy-id node@myserver.com
```
If you encounter any errors, please refer to the troubleshooting section below.

3- Now initialize the remote folder with:

```bash
pm2 deploy <configuration_file> <environment> setup
```

Example:

```bash
pm2 deploy ecosystem.json production setup
```

This command will create the folders on your remote server.

4- Deploy your code

```bash
pm2 deploy ecosystem.json production
```

Now your code will be populated, installed and started with PM2.

## Deployment options

Display deploy help via `pm2 deploy help`:

```
pm2 deploy <configuration_file> <environment> <command>

  Commands:
    setup                run remote setup commands
    update               update deploy to the latest release
    revert [n]           revert to [n]th last deployment or 1
    curr[ent]            output current release commit
    prev[ious]           output previous release commit
    exec|run <cmd>       execute the given <cmd>
    list                 list previous deploy commits
    [ref]                deploy to [ref], the "ref" setting, or latest tag
```

## Use different set of env variables

In the `post-deploy` attribute, you may have noticed the command `pm2 startOrRestart ecosystem.json --env production`. The `--env <environment_name>` allows to inject different sets of environment variables.

Read more [here](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/application-declaration/#switching-to-different-environments).

## Related Commands

```
pm2 startOrRestart all.json            # Invoke restart on all apps in JSON
pm2 startOrReload all.json             # Invoke reload
```

## Multi host deployment

To deploy to multiple hosts in the same time, you just have to declare each host in an array under the attribute `host`.

```javascript
{
  [...]
  "deploy" : {
    "production" : {
      "user" : "node",
      // Multi host in a js array
      "host" : ["212.83.163.1", "212.83.163.2", "212.83.163.3"],
      "ref"  : "origin/master",
      "repo" : "git@github.com:repo.git",
      "path" : "/var/www/production",
      "pre-setup" : "echo 'commands or local script path to be run on the host before the setup process starts'",
      "post-setup": "echo 'commands or a script path to be run on the host after cloning the repo'",
      "post-deploy" : "pm2 startOrRestart ecosystem.json --env production",
      "pre-deploy-local" : "echo 'This is a local executed command'"
    }
  [...]
}
```


## Using SSH keys

You just have to add the "key" attribute with path to the public key, see below example :

```javascript
    "production" : {
      "key"  : "/path/to/some.pem", // path to the public key to authenticate
      "user" : "node",              // user used to authenticate
      "host" : "212.83.163.1",      // where to connect
      "ref"  : "origin/master",
      "repo" : "git@github.com:repo.git",
      "path" : "/var/www/production",
      "post-deploy" : "pm2 startOrRestart ecosystem.json --env production"
    },
```

## Force deployment

You may get this message:

```
--> Deploying to dev environment
--> on host 192.168.1.XX

  push your changes before deploying

Deploy failed
```
That means that you have changes in your local system that aren't pushed inside your git repository, and since the deploy script get the update via `git pull` they will not be on your server.
If you want to deploy without pushing any data, you can append the `--force` option:

```bash
pm2 deploy ecosystem.json production --force
```

## Considerations

- You can use the option `--force` to skip local change detection
- You might want to commit your node_modules folder ([#622](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/issues/622)) or add the `npm install` command to the `post-deploy` section: `"post-deploy" : "npm install && pm2 startOrRestart ecosystem.json --env production"`
- Verify that your remote server has the permission to git clone the repository
- You can declare specific environment variables depending on the environment you want to deploy the code to. For instance to declare variables for the production environment, add "env_production": {} and declare the variables.
- By default, PM2 will use `ecosystem.json`. So you can skip the <configuration_file> options if this is the case
- You can embed the "apps" & "deploy" section in the package.json
- It deploys your code via ssh, you don't need any dependencies
- Processes are initialized / started automatically depending on the application name in `ecosystem.json`
- PM2-deploy repository can be found here: [pm2-deploy](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2-deploy)
- **WINDOWS** : see point below (at the end)

## Troubleshooting
##### SSH clone errors
In most cases, these errors will be caused by `pm2` not having the correct keys to clone your repository. You need to verify at every step that the keys are available.

__Step 1__
If you are certain your keys are correctly working, first try running `git clone your_repo.git` on the target server. If it succeeds, move onto the next steps. If it failed, make sure your keys are stored both on the server and on your git account.

__Step 2__
By default `ssh-copy-id` copies the default identiy, usually named `id_rsa`. If that is not the appropriate key:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i path/to/my/key your_username@server.com
```
This adds your public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

__Step 3__
If you get the following error:
```
--> Deploying to production environment
--> on host mysite.com
  ○ hook pre-setup
  ○ running setup
  ○ cloning git@github.com:user/repo.git
Cloning into '/var/www/app/source'...
Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights and that the repository exists.

**Failed to clone**

Deploy failed
```
...you may want to create a ssh config file. This is a sure way to ensure that the correct ssh keys are used for any given repository you're trying to clone. See [this example](https://gist.github.com/Protosac/c3fb459b1a942f161f23556f61a67d66):

```
# ~/.ssh/config
Host alias
    HostName myserver.com
    User username
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/mykey
# Usage: `ssh alias` 
# Alternative: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/mykey username@myserver.com`

Host deployment
    HostName github.com
    User username
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github_rsa
# Usage:
# git@deployment:username/anyrepo.git 
# This is for cloning any repo that uses that IdentityFile. This is a good way to make sure that your remote cloning commands use the appropriate key
```

## Windows Consideration

To run the deploy script under Windows, you need to use a unix shell like bash, so we recommend to install either [Git bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win), [Babun](http://babun.github.io/) or  [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/install.html)
