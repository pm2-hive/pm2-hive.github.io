## Welcome!

Welcome to the PM2 Quick Start!

PM2 is a daemon process manager that will help you manage and keep your application online. Getting started with PM2 is straightforward, it is offered as a simple and intuitive CLI, installable via NPM.


## Installation

The latest PM2 version is installable with NPM or Yarn:

```bash
$ npm install pm2@latest -g
# or
$ yarn global add pm2
```

To install Node.js and NPM you can use [NVM](https://yoember.com/nodejs/the-best-way-to-install-node-js/)

## Start an app

The simplest way to start, daemonize and monitor your application is by using this command line:

```bash
$ pm2 start app.js
```

Or start any other application easily:

```bash
$ pm2 start bashscript.sh
$ pm2 start python-app.py --watch
$ pm2 start binary-file -- --port 1520
```

Some options you can pass to the CLI:

```bash
# Specify an app name
--name <app_name>

# Watch and Restart app when files change
--watch

# Set memory threshold for app reload
--max-memory-restart <200MB>

# Specify log file
--log <log_path>

# Pass extra arguments to the script
-- arg1 arg2 arg3

# Delay between automatic restarts
--restart-delay <delay in ms>

# Prefix logs with time
--time

# Do not auto restart app
--no-autorestart

# Specify cron for forced restart
--cron <cron_pattern>

# Attach to application log
--no-daemon
```

As you can see many options are available to manage your application with PM2. You will discover them depending on your use case.

## Managing processes

Managing application state is simple here are the commands:

```bash
$ pm2 restart app_name
$ pm2 reload app_name
$ pm2 stop app_name
$ pm2 delete app_name
```

Instead of `app_name` you can pass:
- `all` to act on all processes
- `id` to act on a specific process id

## Check status, logs, metrics

Now that you have started this application, you can check its status, logs, metrics and even get the online dashboard with <a href="https://pm2.io" target="_blank">pm2.io</a>.

### List managed applications

List the status of all application managed by PM2:

```bash
$ pm2 [list|ls|status]
```

### Display logs

To display logs in realtime:

```bash
$ pm2 logs
```

To dig in older logs:

```bash
$ pm2 logs --lines 200
```

### Terminal Based Dashboard

Here is a realtime dashboard that fits directly into your terminal:

```bash
$ pm2 monit
```

### pm2.io: Monitoring & Diagnostic Web Interface

Web based dashboard, cross servers with diagnostic system:

```bash
$ pm2 plus
```

## Cluster mode

For Node.js applications, PM2 includes an automatic load balancer that will share all HTTP[s]/Websocket/TCP/UDP connections between each spawned processes.

To start an application in Cluster mode:

```
$ pm2 start app.js -i max
```

Read more about cluster mode [here](/docs/usage/cluster-mode/).

## Ecosystem File

You can also create a configuration file, called Ecosystem File, to manage multiple applications.
To generate an Ecosystem file:

```bash
$ pm2 ecosystem
```

This will generate and ecosystem.config.js file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps : [{
    name: "app",
    script: "./app.js",
    env: {
      NODE_ENV: "development",
    },
    env_production: {
      NODE_ENV: "production",
    }
  }, {
     name: 'worker',
     script: 'worker.js'
  }]
}
```

And start it easily:

```bash
$ pm2 start process.yml
```

Read more about application declaration [here](/docs/usage/application-declaration/).

## Setup startup script

Restarting PM2 with the processes you manage on server boot/reboot is critical. To solve this, just run this command to generate an active startup script:

```bash
$ pm2 startup
```

And to freeze a process list for automatic respawn:

```bash
$ pm2 save
```
Read more about startup script generator [here](/docs/usage/startup/).

## Restart application on changes

It's pretty easy with the `--watch` option:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/my/app
$ pm2 start env.js --watch --ignore-watch="node_modules"
```

This will watch & restart the app on any file change from the current directory + all subfolders and it will ignore any changes in the node_modules folder `--ignore-watch="node_modules"`. 

You can then use `pm2 logs` to check for restarted app logs.

## Updating PM2

We made it simple, there is no breaking change between releases and the procedure is straightforward:

```bash
npm install pm2@latest -g
```

Then update the in-memory PM2 :

```bash
pm2 update
```

## CheatSheet

Here are some commands that are worth knowing. Just try them with a sample application or with your current web application on your development machine:

```bash
# Fork mode
pm2 start app.js --name my-api # Name process

# Cluster mode
pm2 start app.js -i 0        # Will start maximum processes with LB depending on available CPUs
pm2 start app.js -i max      # Same as above, but deprecated.
pm2 scale app +3             # Scales `app` up by 3 workers
pm2 scale app 2              # Scales `app` up or down to 2 workers total

# Listing

pm2 list               # Display all processes status
pm2 jlist              # Print process list in raw JSON
pm2 prettylist         # Print process list in beautified JSON

pm2 describe 0         # Display all informations about a specific process

pm2 monit              # Monitor all processes

# Logs

pm2 logs [--raw]       # Display all processes logs in streaming
pm2 flush              # Empty all log files
pm2 reloadLogs         # Reload all logs

# Actions

pm2 stop all           # Stop all processes
pm2 restart all        # Restart all processes

pm2 reload all         # Will 0s downtime reload (for NETWORKED apps)

pm2 stop 0             # Stop specific process id
pm2 restart 0          # Restart specific process id

pm2 delete 0           # Will remove process from pm2 list
pm2 delete all         # Will remove all processes from pm2 list

# Misc

pm2 reset <process>    # Reset meta data (restarted time...)
pm2 updatePM2          # Update in memory pm2
pm2 ping               # Ensure pm2 daemon has been launched
pm2 sendSignal SIGUSR2 my-app # Send system signal to script
pm2 start app.js --no-daemon
pm2 start app.js --no-vizion
pm2 start app.js --no-autorestart
```
